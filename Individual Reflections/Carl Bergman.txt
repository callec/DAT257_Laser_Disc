Week 1
* what do I want to learn or understand better?
   * For this week I want to learn scrum and better understand KPI. At this
     point I have some experience in agile development and think I am new to
	 KPIs. To achieve this I should attend the lectures and research both of the
	 topics.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By sharing our previous knowledge of the topics we need to learn more
     about, e.g. agile, scrum, KPIs. 
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   * Previous experience in agile, shared a small summary of scrum that was
     found online.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   * As we have collaborated on all the deliveries so far I would say that it
     currently is where I want it to be. Perhaps a more proactive role in the
	 communication channels could be achieved.


Week 2
* what do I want to learn or understand better?
   * I still want to better understand scrum development. Further on we will
     most likely work with flutter to be able to develop for both android and
	 ios at the same time, so I want to learn that too. Will read articles on
	 both to learn further.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By sharing our previous knowledge of the topics we need to learn more
     about, for this week mostly android development.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   * Discussing how we should improve our current strategies to work in a
     ‘scrum’ way.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   * As we have collaborated on all the deliveries so far I would say that it
     currently is where I want it to be.
