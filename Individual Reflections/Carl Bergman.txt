Wk 1
* what do I want to learn or understand better?
   * For this week I want to learn scrum and better understand KPI. At this
     point I have some experience in agile development and think I am new to
     KPIs. To achieve this I should attend the lectures and research both of the
     topics.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By sharing our previous knowledge of the topics we need to learn more
     about, e.g. agile, scrum, KPIs.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   * Previous experience in agile, shared a small summary of scrum that was
     found online.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   * As we have collaborated on all the deliveries so far I would say that it
     currently is where I want it to be. Perhaps a more proactive role in the
     communication channels could be achieved.


Week 2
* what do I want to learn or understand better?
   * I still want to better understand scrum development. Further on we will
     most likely work with flutter to be able to develop for both android and
     ios at the same time, so I want to learn that too. Will read articles on
     both to learn further.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By sharing our previous knowledge of the topics we need to learn more
     about, for this week mostly android development.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   * Discussing how we should improve our current strategies to work in a
     ‘scrum’ way.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   * As we have collaborated on all the deliveries so far I would say that it
     currently is where I want it to be.


Week 3
* what do I want to learn or understand better?
   * I wish to understand how HAST want the app to work. I have been filled in
     by my teammates but I still feel that my understanding is lacking. To
     achieve this I will listen well and ask questions during the meetings with
     HAST. As the other weeks I still want to know more about scrum development
     and how flutter works.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By sharing our previous knowledge of the topics we need to learn more
     about, for this week mostly programming and git.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   * Discussing how we should improve our current strategies to work in a
     ‘scrum’ way. As well as giving suggestions on ways that the
     current roles could be modified to achieve better results.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   * We have collaborated on all deliveries but I feel that we as a group could
     be more productive, I am uncertain how to reach that level as we all need
     teach ourselves flutter which is new to all of us.
     This week I was the team leader and I am satisfied with my performance.


Week 4
* what do I want to learn or understand better?
   * I want to learn how to structure flutter applications in a way that makes
     it easy for other and myself how they work and how to add on to them.
     To achieve this i will read about it on my own and do some local tests
     for our project. Currently I know basic app structure such as MVVM and MVC
     but I do not know how to apply it to flutter/dart.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By sharing our previous knowledge of the topics we need to learn more
     about, for this week mostly programming and git, as well as pair
     programming with screen sharing to help my programming partner(s).
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   * Discussing how we should improve our current strategies to work in a
     ‘scrum’ way, as well as helping my programming partner(s)
     to better understand how git/dart.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   * This week we have collaborated (as usual) and I am fairly satisfied with
     how it went. I still feel that we could be more productive but it
     is not easy to achieve as we need to consider the teams overall knowledge
     of development as well as arringing meetings when everyone is available.

Week 5
* what do I want to learn or understand better?
   * I want to learn how to export data from a flutter application and
     possible implement a database. I also want to learn how to make adaptive
     UIs that changes when the resolution changes.
* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
   * By sharing our previous knowledge of the topics we need to learn more
     about, for this week mostly programming patterns and design of backend.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   * Discussing how we should improve our current strategies to work in a
     ‘scrum’ way.
* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   * This week we have collaborated (as usual) and I am satisfied with how it
     went. This week I tested a design pattern for the backend that worked out
     well so we decided to implement it, as well as working together on the
     use stories as usual.
